# Free Fish

by 👤Gabriel Cubbage

Down from the highlands that feed the Das Antas, there unwinds a wild river, home to countless tainhas — shimmering green and gray, ray-finned fish. Most embrace the torrent without care, trusting the currents as they cavort and splash along, leaping to gulp at the air and enjoy the unbroken sunlight. But some few choose to fight the river instead, laboring in the shallows, to slow their downstream rush. Some even leap edgeward from the water’s safety, dashing themselves high against the jagged embankments, threatening to exit the river entirely.

Their frolicking brethren call out from the river’s spine as they pass, "Hey! Get away from the embankments. Don't you know splashing about in the current is best?”

The would-be escapees pause in their leaping to cry back, "Says you! But you fail to understand that we are all undecided."

"Undecided? But that's no place for you! If you left the river, you’d surely die. And besides, it’s too high. And double besides, it's more fun in here!"

"Estás a meter água!” the contrarians jeer. “You only say that because you're fish! And fish love to play in the middle of the river, where the water moves fastest.”

"But… you're fish, too! Sem noção. Don’t you know that?”

“Of course. Naturally, we know we're fish. Everyone’s a fish. But no one here can decide." The dissatisfied tainhas resume their escape attempts even more urgently.

"But why, why, why can’t you decide? If you know the embankment's too high to breach, you know playing in the current is most fun for fish, and you know that you are fish, then why not come be over here with us? There's absolutely nothing for you to decide!"

"EXACTLY!"
