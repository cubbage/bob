# Bob - User Guide

## What is Bob?

Bob is a powerful text processing and document analysis tool that helps you transform, analyze, and visualize text in ways that make patterns and relationships visible. Think of it as a "smart highlighter" that can automatically color-code different types of information in your documents.

## What Bob Does

### 1. **Document Processing & Text Extraction**
Bob can take various document formats and extract readable text from them:
- **PDF files** (scanned documents, forms, reports)
- **Word documents** (.doc, .docx)
- **Excel spreadsheets** (.xls, .xlsx)
- **PowerPoint presentations** (.ppt, .pptx)
- **Plain text files** (.txt)

### 2. **Smart Text Colorization & Pattern Recognition**
Once you have text, Bob can automatically identify and color-code different types of information:
- **People's names** (highlighted in blue backgrounds)
- **Dates and times** (highlighted in specific colors)
- **Numbers and quantities** (each digit gets its own color)
- **Colors mentioned in text** (the word "red" gets colored red)
- **Musical instruments** (highlighted with instrument emojis)
- **School subjects** (highlighted with book emojis)
- **Sounds and textures** (highlighted with sound emojis)
- **And much more...**

### 3. **Real-time Pattern Building**
You can create your own custom patterns to highlight specific information:
- **Regex patterns** for complex text matching
- **Custom color schemes** for different categories
- **Priority-based highlighting** (most important patterns apply first)
- **Group organization** with emoji indicators

### 4. **Multiple Export Options**
After processing, you can export your colorized text in various formats:
- **Markdown** with inline HTML styling
- **PDF documents** with preserved colors
- **HTML** for web use
- **Plain text** for further processing
- **Shareable URLs** that automatically load your text and settings

### Working with Patterns

#### Creating a New Group
1. Go to the "Default Search Pattern + Groups" tab
2. Click "+ Add Group"
3. Select a category (person, color, instrument, etc.)
4. Choose colors and styles for the group
5. The group will automatically start highlighting matching text

#### Adding Objects to Groups
1. In the "Objects" section, click "+ Add Object"
2. Enter a label (e.g., "Red")
3. Set colors and styles
4. Enter a regex pattern (e.g., "red" to match the word "red")
5. Select which group it belongs to

#### Customizing the Default Pattern
1. In the "Default Search Pattern" section
2. Build a regex pattern using the interface:
   - **^** (start anchor): Match beginning of text
   - **\b** (word boundary): Match word boundaries
   - **Base pattern**: The main regex (e.g., "[A-Z]{1,4}" for 1-4 capital letters)
   - **Custom toggles**: Add additional regex components
3. Set colors and styles for unmatched text

### Advanced Features

## Tips and Tricks

### Pattern Building
- **Start simple**: Begin with basic word matching before complex regex
- **Test incrementally**: Use the "Current Matches" display to verify patterns
- **Use word boundaries**: Add `\b` to match whole words only
- **Case sensitivity**: Patterns are case-insensitive by default

### Color Management
- **Contrast matters**: Choose colors that provide good contrast with text
- **Consistency**: Use similar colors for related categories
- **Accessibility**: Consider colorblind-friendly color schemes
- **Export compatibility**: Some colors may not export perfectly to all formats

### Performance
- **Large texts**: For very long documents, process in smaller chunks
- **Complex patterns**: Avoid overly complex regex that might slow down processing
- **Browser compatibility**: Modern browsers work best with all features

### Troubleshooting
- **Patterns not matching**: Check regex syntax and case sensitivity
- **Colors not showing**: Verify color format (hex codes work best)
- **Export issues**: Try different export formats if one doesn't work
- **Data persistence**: Clear localStorage if configuration gets corrupted
